# Data-Mining---Graph-Theory-Tutorial
This repo contains the source for a tutorial on graph theory for SYS  6018 - Data Mining Course at UVA

This tutorial uses tools learned from the course to cover concepts in graph theory beyond the field of data mining, while keeping its applications in the field in mind.

This tutorial covers topics such as graph representations, traversal algorithms (breadth-first, depth-first), and shortest path algorithms
